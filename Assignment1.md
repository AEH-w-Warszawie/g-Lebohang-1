# Welcome to Lebo's Life
## Myself
My name is Lebohang Phidah. I am a man aged 21 studying computer engineering in the city of Warsaw in Poland.
## *Zimbabwe*
I am a proud African from the country of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is located in southern africa. Although the country is not really rich but it is rich in minerals. Gold and DIamond you name it.
The main staple food in Zimbabwe is sadza and Gango. Zimbabwe is the home to one of the seven wonders which is the victoria falls located in the western side of the country.
The weather in Zimbabwe is fairly warm not really as cold as PolandðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
Zimbabwe is home to a lot of wild life with a lot of safaris to go to and some places where you can hunt wild meat.
### Economy
Zimbabwe's economy is based on agricultural, mining and tourism activities. Zimbabwe was once known as the bread basket of Africa as it provided food to most of the countries in Africa.
Although the country has been facing a lot of economical and political challenges it is growing now.
